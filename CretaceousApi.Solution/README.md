#  Cretaceous Park - an API Solution

#### By Chris Johnedis, John Diggins, & Vera Weikel 

#### This is a project to build Basic Web Api Application using ASP .Net, MVC, and EF Core databases.

## Technologies Used

* .Net 6 SDK
* C#
* EFCore
* ASP.Net MVC
* Razor
* Identity
* Api

## Goals/Objectives

This project shows how to connect an ASP.NET Core MVC project to a MySQL database using [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

## Description

This project uses Identity in an ASP.NET Core API project to authenticate users.

## Endpoints: 

Document our API's endpoints, make sure we consider what is in our API. For example, in our API:

* We have multiple endpoints, all of which we want to include in our documentation.
* Some endpoints include optional query strings that we'll want to document.
* Some endpoints require a body to be included along with the request.

GET http://localhost:5000/api/tryjson/  (*pagination)<br> 
GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals/<br> 
GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals/{id}<br> 
POST http://localhost:5000/api/animals/<br> 
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/animals/{id}<br> 
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/animals/{id}<br> 

Note: The {id} in the URL is a variable and it should be replaced with the id number of the animal the user wants to GET, PUT, or DELETE.

pageNumber	    | int	| not required	| Returns a specified page number of query items<br> 
resultsPerPage	| int	| not required	| Returns a specified number of query items per page

| species              | String           | not required   | Returns animals with a matching species value|<br> 

◊ GET http://localhost:5000/api/animalstryjson?pagenumber=[ENTER-AN-INT-A-PAGE-NUMBER]&resultperpage=[ENTER-AN-INT-RESULTS-PER-PAGE]
name	    | String	| not required	 | Returns animals with a matching species value 

◊ GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals?species=[ENTER-MATCHING-SPECIES-VALUE]
name	    | String	| not required	 | Returns animals with a matching name value 

◊ GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals?name=[ENTER-MATCHING-NAME-VALUE]
minimumAge | Number	| not required  | Returns animals that have an age value that is greater than or equal to the specified minimumAge value

◊ GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals?minimumAge=[ENTER-MINIMUM-AGE-INTEGER-VALUE]
species&minimumAge | String & Number | neither required	| Returns animals with a matching species value and an age value that is greater than or equal to the specified minimumAge value

◊ GET http://localhost:5000/api/animals?species=[ENTER-MATCHING-SPECIES-VALUE]&minimumAge=[ENTER-MINIMUM-AGE-INTEGER-VALUE]

◊ POST request to http://localhost:5000/api/animals/, must have a JSON body included when being made. Here is an example body in JSON:

```json 
{
  "species": "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
  "name": "Elizabeth",
  "age": 8
}
``` 

◊ PUT request we would send the previous body to:

http://localhost:5000/api/animals/1
Notice that the value of animalId needs to match the id number in the URL. In this example, they are both 1.

## Pagination for the API

Access the API endpoint with a query parameter that specifies the page that should be returned and the number of results per page. For example, the query string /records?page=2 might return page 2 of the results. This creates a page that does simple grouping.

GET http://localhost:5000/api/tryjson/


## How To Run This Project

If you have not already, install the `dotnet-ef` tool by running the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
$ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
$ dotnet add package RestSharp --version 108.0.3
$ dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.2
```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory.
3. Within the production directory create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `root` and the `pwd` is `epicodus`.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*", 
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=cretaceous_api;uid=[YOUR-USERNAME];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD];"
  }
}

```
5. Within the production directory create a new file called `appsettings.Development.json`.
6. Within `appsettings.Development.json`, put in the following code:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Update the database using the migrations in the  project. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory, and run `dotnet ef database update`. 
    - To optionally create a migration, remove any existing folders and/or run the command `dotnet ef migrations remove`.  Then, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName` where `MigrationName` is your custom name for the migration in UpperCamelCase. To learn more about migrations, visit the LHTP lesson [Code First Development and Migrations](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/many-to-many-relationships/code-first-development-and-migrations).
6. Within the production directory, run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5000. If you cannot access localhost:5000 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).

## Database Instructions 

* In your terminal type to create a db migration: $ dotnet ef migrations add Initial
* Updating the Database with the Migration: $ dotnet ef database update

## DB (Optional)

* If you would like to see a current view of the database: Open SQL workbench.
* Navigate to the "Administration" tab in SQL Workbench.
* Click "Schema" 
* Right hand mouse click "Refresh All".
* The _Name the schema "project_name" of the database in this current project will be in view

## Known Bugs

* None
