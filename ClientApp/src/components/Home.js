          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACO8nOkBZc3ijFmRr2t0VBykSpwjPmoJUmI" data-attribute-index="3" data-entity-type="MINI_PROFILE">Kayla King</a>,
          who is passionate about promoting restaurants that cater to people with food restrictions and allergies. As founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/findmymeal/" data-attribute-index="5" data-entity-type="MINI_COMPANY">MyMeal</a>, she is revolutionizing the way people with food allergies, celiac disease, and restrictive diets eat out.
          <br />
          <ul> Here are three key takeaways:

            <li> ü•£ Restaurants and other food service outlets that show empathy and accommodate individuals with food allergies can gain loyal, repeat customers.</li>

            <li>üç¥ Inclusion in the food environment normalizes the experience of having dietary restrictions or allergies.</li>

            <li>üçΩÔ∏è Empathy is crucial on both sides for individuals with food allergies/dietary restrictions and restaurant servers and owners.</li>
          </ul> 
        
          <strong>Listen </strong>to the episode on your favorite podcast platform to learn more about how people with food restrictions have to be hyper-vigilant about what they consume and how Kayla and MyMeal are promoting a safe and confident food and beverage experience.

        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to your new single-page application, built with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
          <li><a href='https://facebook.github.io/react/'>React</a> for client-side code</li>
          <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To help you get started, we have also set up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
          <li><strong>Development server integration</strong>. In development mode, the development server from <code>create-react-app</code> runs in the background automatically, so your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand and the page refreshes when you modify any file.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and your <code>dotnet publish</code> configuration produces minified, efficiently bundled JavaScript files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>ClientApp</code> subdirectory is a standard React application based on the <code>create-react-app</code> template. If you open a command prompt in that directory, you can run <code>npm</code> commands such as <code>npm test</code> or <code>npm install</code>.</p>
